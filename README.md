  <h1>Zera Bank System</h1>

  <p>This is a Python project for a simple banking system that allows users to create profiles, log in, and perform basic banking operations such as withdrawal, deposit, account closure, changing PIN, and checking deposited money.</p>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>The project uses a JSON file ("database.json") to store user profiles and their banking information. Each user has a name, PIN, and salary. The system also logs user actions in a separate text file ("logs.txt").</p>

  <h2>How to Use</h2>

  <p>Clone the repository and run the Python script. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new bank profile or login with existing credentials. Once logged in, choose from the available banking options by entering the corresponding number.</p>

  ```python
  python banking_system.py
  ```
